# 2. Why DevOps Exists?
### Breaking Silos Between Development & Operations
Traditionally, software teams were divided into silos:
* Development (Dev): Focused on writing code quickly, innovating new features.
* Operations (Ops): Focused on stability, keeping systems running without changes that could cause outages.

### This created conflict:
* Dev wanted frequent releases → Ops saw them as risky.
* "Over-the-wall" handoffs: Dev throws code to Ops, leading to delays, blame, and slow delivery.

* DevOps emerged to bridge these silos by fostering collaboration, shared responsibility, and automation. 
* It integrates Dev and Ops (and often QA, Security) into unified teams working toward common goals: delivering value faster and reliably.

> * DevOps will empower to influence the full lifecycle, reducing those painful handoff issues.

# 3. CALMS Framework
___________________

### CALMS is a popular model to assess and guide DevOps adoption. 

It stands for:
1. **Culture**: Shift to collaboration, blameless post-mortems, and shared ownership. No more finger-pointing!
1. **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks (testing, deployments) to reduce errors and speed up processes.
1. **Lean**: Eliminate waste, focus on value delivery (like Agile principles applied end-to-end).
1. **Measurement**: Track metrics (deployment frequency, lead time, failure rates) to improve continuously.
1. **Sharing**: Open knowledge sharing, tools, and best practices across teams.

# 4. Key Benefits of DevOps
--------------------------
1. **Faster Delivery:** Frequent, automated releases (from months to days/hours).
1. **Higher Quality:** Automated testing and monitoring catch issues early.
1. **Reduced Risk:** Smaller changes are easier to rollback; collaboration prevents big failures.
